# vetosh

**A universal, no-code RAG server for any vector database — powered by the
[Pathway](https://pathway.com) Live Data Framework.**

Set up real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation over your own documents without
writing any code. Point vetosh at a folder, pick a vector database and an
embedder in a YAML file, and run a few commands.

<p align="center"><em>From zero to a live RAG stack — <code>quickstart → indexer → server → frontend</code> — then chat with your documents.</em></p>

```bash
pip install "vetosh[openai]"

vetosh quickstart                       # interactive config wizard
vetosh up --config config.yaml          # indexer + server together → http://localhost:8000
```

(Or run `vetosh indexer` and `vetosh server` separately — that is what `up`
supervises, and how production deployments split them.)

The server hosts both the web chat UI (on `/`) and the versioned REST API
(under `/api/v1`) on one port:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/retrieve \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "how does persistence work?", "k": 5}'
```

## Highlights

- **No code.** Configure everything in one YAML file (or generate it with
  `vetosh quickstart`).
- **Any vector DB — 8 backends.** DuckDB (embedded, zero setup — the default),
  pgvector, Qdrant, Milvus, ChromaDB, Weaviate, Pinecone and MongoDB Atlas
  Vector Search. Every backend is written through Pathway's **native
  `pw.io.*` connectors** in snapshot mode, so file edits and deletions become
  real upserts/deletes in the store.
- **Zero-setup default.** `type: duckdb` needs no external service and does
  vector search *inside the database* (`list_cosine_similarity` over native
  `DOUBLE[]` columns) — no linear scans in Python anywhere.
- **Live & incremental.** Built on Pathway: additions, edits and deletions are
  reflected in the vector DB in real time. Sources are read in `only_metadata`
  mode, so a large corpus stays tiny in the pipeline.
- **Multiple sources.** Local filesystem, Google Drive, S3/MinIO and
  SharePoint (all `only_metadata`), mixed freely in one config.
- **Reuses `pathway.xpacks.llm`.** Parsers, splitters and embedders are used
  as-is — vetosh implements none of its own. Five embedder families (OpenAI,
  LiteLLM, SentenceTransformers, Gemini, Bedrock) work identically on the
  indexer and the server side — including a fully local, credential-free
  stack with `sentence_transformer` + DuckDB.
- **Decoupled & scalable.** Indexer and API server are independent processes
  sharing only the vector DB; the server is stateless and scales horizontally.
- **Web chat UI, same port.** `vetosh server` serves a clean
  ChatGPT/Claude-style chat page on `/` next to the versioned API
  (`/api/v1/...`) — same origin, no CORS, nothing extra to run. For split
  deployments (UI on a different host) there is a standalone
  `vetosh frontend` proxy tier.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="vetosh architecture: sources feed the Pathway indexer, which writes through native pw.io connectors into one of 8 vector databases; the stateless server embeds queries, searches the database and serves the chat UI and the /api/v1 REST API" width="100%">
</p>

**The two halves are fully decoupled.** The indexer (write path) and the
server (read path) are separate processes — different executables that never
talk to each other. Their only contract is the vector database itself:

- **Independent scaling.** The server is stateless and read-only — run any
  number of instances behind a load balancer; each also serves the chat UI at
  zero cost. The indexer scales separately with Pathway's multi-worker
  support. Bulk re-indexing never slows down query serving, and query spikes
  never stall indexing.
- **Failure isolation.** If the indexer is down, serving continues over the
  last-synced data; if the server is down, indexing keeps the database fresh.
  Either side can be restarted or upgraded independently (the indexer resumes
  from its persistence without re-embedding).
- **The database stays yours.** Vectors live in *your* store in a plain,
  documented schema — other consumers (BI, other apps, a different retrieval
  stack) can read the same collection; vetosh doesn't hold it hostage.
- **Optional third tier.** For split deployments (UI on a different host than
  the API) a standalone `vetosh frontend` serves the same chat page and
  proxies to the API server-side.

The one deliberate exception: the embedded DuckDB backend trades this
distribution for zero setup — one local file, single-writer, ideal for
laptops and demos (see [docs](docs/README.md) for its concurrency note).

## Benchmarks

The claim that matters: **the indexer's memory footprint does not depend on
the corpus size.** Sources are read in `only_metadata` mode — documents flow
through the pipeline instead of accumulating in it — so memory is a constant
set by the worker count and the local embedding model, while corpus size only
affects wall-clock time.

Self-contained benchmark (docker-compose: Qdrant + indexer + server, fully
local embeddings, zero API cost) over a Wikipedia corpus —
see [benchmarks/realtime-data-indexing](benchmarks/realtime-data-indexing):

| corpus | ≈ pages | docs | chunks | indexing time | peak RSS | in Qdrant | retrieval accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 MB | 52 000 | 12 969 | 66 136 | 8.3 min | 18.0 GB* | 0.6 GB | 5/5 |
| 1 GB | 524 000 | 240 516 | 836 595 | 88 min | 23.6 GB* | 2.7 GB | 16/20 |
| 3 GB | 1 573 000 | 841 890 | 2 703 850 | 4.5 h | 35.6 GB* | 7.6 GB | 17/20 |

\* **A 30× larger corpus costs 30× the time (throughput is flat at
~11–12 MB/min) but only ~2× the peak memory.** The floor is 8 Pathway worker
processes × ~1.5–2 GB of local sentence-transformers stack each (PyTorch
runtime + model + inference buffers) — set by the worker count, not by data
volume. The residual growth comes from per-file watch metadata and from the
in-flight batch buffer during the *initial bulk backfill* (the whole
pre-existing corpus lands in a few huge commits); in steady-state watching,
where documents arrive over time, that buffer stays small. Document contents
never accumulate in the pipeline (`only_metadata`).

</p>

Setup: 96-core CPU host, streaming mode, 8 worker processes
(`indexer.workers: 8`), local `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings (384 dims),
512-token chunks, Qdrant as the vector store. Retrieval accuracy = distinctive
articles sampled from the corpus must come back for their own queries via
`/api/v1/retrieve`.

## Requirements

Python ≥ 3.10 (the minimum supported by Pathway).

## Documentation

Full installation, quickstart, configuration reference, persistence,
architecture and scaling notes live in **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,openai]"
pytest -m "not slow"            # fast unit tests (no Pathway, no services)
pytest -m "slow and not integration"   # end-to-end indexer tests (spin up Pathway)
pytest -m integration          # real-database tests (see below)
pytest                         # everything
```

Per-backend clients install as extras — pick what you use:

```bash
pip install "vetosh[qdrant]"      # also: pgvector, milvus, chroma, weaviate,
                                  #       pinecone, mongodb, local, gemini, all
```

### Integration tests (real databases)

**Every claimed backend has an integration test** running the same scenario
end-to-end against a real instance: index two documents with the real indexer,
retrieve through the production accessor (exact-text query must rank first
with cosine ~1.0), delete a file, re-index, and verify its vectors are gone
(snapshot semantics). The shared driver lives in `tests/integration_common.py`.

| Backend | Test | Real instance |
|---|---|---|
| DuckDB | `test_integration_duckdb.py` | embedded — runs everywhere |
| pgvector | `test_integration_pgvector.py` | `pgvector/pgvector` Docker container |
| Milvus | `test_integration_milvus.py` | embedded Milvus Lite engine |
| Qdrant | `test_integration_qdrant.py` | `qdrant/qdrant` Docker container |
| ChromaDB | `test_integration_chroma.py` | `chromadb/chroma` Docker container |
| Weaviate | `test_integration_weaviate.py` | `semitechnologies/weaviate` Docker container |
| Pinecone | `test_integration_pinecone.py` | official `pinecone-local` emulator (Docker) |
| MongoDB | `test_integration_mongodb.py` | `mongodb-atlas-local` (mongod + mongot, real `$vectorSearch`) |

Containers are throwaway (`tests/dockerutil.py`, Docker CLI via subprocess, no
extra dependency) and host ports are **allocated dynamically** — tests never
assume a fixed localhost port is free or that a service is already running.
Each test skips automatically when Docker or its client library is missing.
