# vetosh

**A universal, no-code RAG server for any vector database — powered by the
[Pathway](https://pathway.com) Live Data Framework.**

vetosh lets you stand up production Retrieval-Augmented Generation over your own
documents without writing code. You point it at a folder, choose a vector
database and an embedder in a YAML file (or generate one with an interactive
wizard), and run two commands:

- **`vetosh indexer`** — a Pathway streaming pipeline that watches your files,
  parses and chunks them, embeds the chunks and keeps your vector DB in sync
  (additions, modifications and deletions) in real time.
- **`vetosh server`** — a FastAPI service that embeds incoming queries and
  retrieves the most relevant chunks (and, optionally, answers them with an
  LLM). It also serves the web chat UI on `/` (same port, same origin) unless
  `server.serve_frontend` is disabled; the REST API lives under `/api/v1`.

The indexer and the server are fully decoupled: they share only the vector
database, so you can scale them independently.

---

## 1. Installation

vetosh requires **Python ≥ 3.10** (the minimum supported by Pathway).

```bash
pip install vetosh

# include the OpenAI client if you use OpenAI embedders / the /rag endpoint
pip install "vetosh[openai]"
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,openai]"
```

---

## 2. Quickstart

The fastest way to get a valid config is the interactive wizard:

```bash
vetosh quickstart
```

It walks you through every option (each with a sensible default — press Enter to
accept), then writes a YAML file. You only *have* to provide document paths,
vector-DB connection details, API keys and your Pathway license key.

Then run the two components (in separate terminals or on separate machines):

```bash
# One command: indexer + server supervised together (dev/demo convenience)
vetosh up --config config.yaml         # open http://localhost:8989

# ... or run the components separately (how production deploys them):
# 1. Index your documents into the vector DB and keep it live
vetosh indexer --config config.yaml

# 2. Serve the chat UI + retrieval / RAG API on one port
vetosh server --config config.yaml     # open http://localhost:8989

# (optional, split deployments only) standalone UI tier on another host
vetosh frontend --config config.yaml   # open http://localhost:3000
```

Query the API (versioned under `/api/v1`; the pre-versioning `/retrieve`,
`/rag` and `/health` paths still work as deprecated aliases):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8989/api/v1/retrieve \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "how does persistence work?", "k": 5}'
```

```jsonc
{
  "results": [
    {"text": "...", "metadata": {"path": "/data/docs/guide.pdf", ...}, "score": 0.95}
  ]
}
```

If you configured an `llm` section, the `/rag` endpoint also answers questions:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8989/api/v1/rag \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "summarize the onboarding guide", "k": 5}'
```

```jsonc
{ "answer": "...", "sources": [ {"text": "...", "metadata": {...}, "score": 0.91} ] }
```

## 3. Pathway License Key

Pathway requires a **free** license key. Get yours in one click at
**<https://pathway.com/framework/get-license>** (email or LinkedIn sign-in).

Provide it either via the config file:

```yaml
pathway_license_key: ${PATHWAY_LICENSE_KEY}
```

or directly as a string. Using the `${PATHWAY_LICENSE_KEY}` form keeps the key
out of the file — set it in the environment:

```bash
export PATHWAY_LICENSE_KEY="your-key-here"
```

The key is applied when the indexing graph is initialized.

---

## 4. Config reference

A single YAML file can configure both the indexer and the server (a *universal*
config), or you can split it into an indexer-only and a server-only file. Any
string value supports `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation, so credentials never need to be
hardcoded.

**Supported embedders** (from `pathway.xpacks.llm.embedders`): `openai`,
`litellm` (≈100 providers), `sentence_transformer` (fully local, no
credentials — install `vetosh[local]`), `gemini`, `bedrock`. Every family has a
matching async client on the server side, so one `embedder` section serves both
components; make sure the indexer and server use the **same** model so vectors
are comparable.

### Sources

vetosh only supports sources that offer Pathway's **`only_metadata`** read mode —
the graph holds just paths/identifiers and metadata (never the file bytes), and
the bytes are fetched on demand during parsing. That keeps the memory footprint
tiny (1 GB of PDFs stays a few KB in the pipeline). Today that means:

- **`fs`** — a local directory, watched recursively per `glob`.
- **`gdrive`** — a Google Drive folder or file. Create a Google **service
  account**, download its JSON key, share the target folder with the service
  account's email, and point `service_user_credentials_file` at the key. See the
  [Pathway Google Drive connector guide](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/connect/connectors/gdrive-connector/).
  Install the extra: `pip install "vetosh[gdrive]"`.
- **`s3`** — an S3 bucket or key prefix, including S3-compatible stores
  (MinIO, DigitalOcean, Wasabi) via `endpoint` + `with_path_style: true`.
  Credentials fall back to the standard AWS chain when omitted. No extra
  needed (boto3 ships with Pathway).
- **`sharepoint`** — a SharePoint directory or file, authenticated with an
  app-registration certificate (`tenant`, `client_id`, `cert_path`,
  `thumbprint`). Requires a Pathway **Scale** license and
  `pip install "vetosh[sharepoint]"`.

You can list several sources of mixed types. **pyfilesystem** gained
`only_metadata` support in the same Pathway change (#10483) and is next in
line to be wired into `sources:`.

### Vector database backends

Every backend is written through Pathway's **native `pw.io.*` output
connector** in snapshot/upsert mode keyed by the chunk id, so file additions,
edits and deletions become real inserts/updates/deletes in the store. The
server retrieves through each database's own vector-search API — there are no
linear scans in Python anywhere.

#### DuckDB (embedded — the zero-setup default)

```yaml
vector_db:
  type: duckdb
  path: ./embeddings.duckdb
  table: vetosh_embeddings
```

No external service and no setup: the file and table are created automatically
(`pw.io.duckdb`, snapshot mode). Embeddings are stored as native `DOUBLE[]`
columns and queried **inside DuckDB** with `list_cosine_similarity` — a
vectorized, columnar scan that answers in milliseconds for local corpora.

Concurrency: DuckDB allows one read-write process *or* several read-only
processes per file — never both. vetosh resolves this with Pathway's
`detach_between_batches`: the streaming indexer releases the file lock
between minibatches, and the server's short-lived read-only connections (with
a retry through brief lock windows) query it concurrently — live indexing and
serving work on one file. On older Pathway builds without the flag, vetosh
warns and falls back to the hold-the-lock behavior (use `mode: static`
there).

#### pgvector table

Create the target table with a `vector(n)` column sized to your embedder's
dimension, e.g. for `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
CREATE TABLE vetosh_embeddings (
  chunk_id  text PRIMARY KEY,
  text      text,
  metadata  jsonb,
  embedding vector(1536)
);
```

(The indexer writes the chunk primary key to the `chunk_id` column.)

#### Milvus collection

Create the collection ahead of time with a primary key field `id` (VARCHAR), a
`text` (VARCHAR) field, a `metadata` (JSON) field and an `embedding`
(FLOAT_VECTOR) field of the right dimension, indexed with the `COSINE` metric.

#### Qdrant

Nothing to create: the indexer (`pw.io.qdrant`, gRPC) auto-creates the
collection with the cosine metric on first write. The chunk's `text` and
`metadata` travel in the point payload; the server queries over REST.
Set `api_key` for Qdrant Cloud.

#### ChromaDB

Create the collection first (the connector never creates it), with the cosine
distance:

```python
client.create_collection("vetosh_embeddings", metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"})
```

The chunk text is stored as the Chroma document and the source metadata as a
JSON string (Chroma metadata values must be scalars).

#### Weaviate

Create the collection first (capitalized name, e.g. `VetoshEmbeddings`). The
chunk vector is stored as the object vector; `text` / `metadata` (JSON string)
/ `chunk_id` become properties. The server's v4 client needs both the HTTP and
gRPC ports.

#### Pinecone

Create the index first with your embedder's dimension (cosine metric). The
`text` and JSON-string `metadata` are stored as record metadata. The API key
comes from `api_key` or `$PINECONE_API_KEY`.

#### MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

The indexer writes one document per chunk (`pw.io.mongodb`, snapshot mode);
the database/collection are auto-created. Create an Atlas `vectorSearch` index
(default name `vector_index`) on the `embedding` path with `numDimensions`
matching your embedder and the `cosine` similarity; the server retrieves with
`$vectorSearch`.

---

## 5. Persistence

When `persistence.enabled: true`, the indexer uses Pathway's built-in
persistence backend plus a `DefaultCache` UDF call-cache on the embedder. On
restart, Pathway replays its persisted state and re-emits only the *diffs* since
the last run, so:

- **unchanged documents are not re-embedded** (the embedder cache and operator
  state are restored), and
- **documents removed while the indexer was down are correctly retracted** from
  the vector DB on the next run.

The same persistence directory also hosts the **parse cache**
(`runtime_calls/`, via `pw.udfs.DefaultCache` — diskcache, LRU-bounded by
`indexer.parse_cache_size_gb`, default 8): extracted document text stays warm
across restarts, so unchanged documents are neither re-downloaded nor
re-parsed. Disabling persistence also disables the parse cache.

Engine monitoring (advanced, `indexer.monitoring_http_port`): when set, every
worker process serves the Pathway engine's built-in observability endpoints on
`127.0.0.1:(port + worker index)` — `GET /metrics` (Prometheus: input/output
latency gauges, per-operator row counters) and `GET /status`.

Disabling persistence still produces identical vectors for a given set of files;
it only forgoes the cross-restart diffing and caching.

---

## 6. Unsupported formats

vetosh never implements its own parsers — it dispatches each file to a
`pathway.xpacks.llm.parsers` parser by extension:

- `.pdf` → `PypdfParser`
- `.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, `.text` → `Utf8Parser`
- everything else → `UnstructuredParser` (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, EML, CSV, RTF,
  EPUB and the other formats supported by [unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/))

Not supported out of the box:

- **Images** (`.png`, `.jpg`, …) and **audio/video** — these require the vision
  (`ImageParser`/`SlideParser`) or Whisper (`AudioParser`) parsers, which need a
  multimodal model and are not wired into the default dispatch.
- **Encrypted / password-protected PDFs.**
- **Google-native files** (Google Docs/Sheets/Slides) from a `gdrive` source —
  they have no direct binary download and would need an export step (TODO).
  Regular uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, …) in Drive work fine.
- Any format not handled by the `unstructured` library version you have
  installed.

Unsupported files are skipped (they simply produce no chunks).

```

**Why `only_metadata`?** The filesystem connector only ever puts *paths and
metadata* into the graph, never file contents — so 1 GB of PDFs costs a few KB in
the pipeline. Text is extracted on demand inside the parse UDF.

**Deletion handling.** The parse UDF is non-deterministic, so Pathway memoizes
its output and, when a file is removed, re-emits that stored text *negated*
without re-reading the (now gone) file; the retraction flows through chunking and
embedding and the sink deletes exactly the matching vectors.

---

## 8. Scaling

The indexer and the server are **separate processes that share only the vector
database**:

- **Server.** Stateless and read-only against the vector DB — run as many
  instances as you like behind a load balancer, across machines or availability
  zones. Because it is fully async (coroutines, not a thread pool), each instance
  handles many concurrent network-bound retrieval calls efficiently. Each
  instance also serves the chat UI (static, zero overhead), so the UI scales
  with the API for free.
- **Frontend (optional split tier).** When the UI must live on a different
  host than the API, `vetosh frontend` is a separate, stateless web tier that
  serves the same chat page and proxies to the API at `frontend.api_url`
  server-side (the API address never reaches the browser).
- **Indexer.** Runs as its own long-lived process and can be scaled with
  Pathway's multi-worker support; its persistence lets it resume without
  re-embedding.
- **Vector database.** Scaling and replicating the vector DB itself is the
  user's responsibility and follows that database's own guidance. (The embedded
  DuckDB backend is the exception: it lives in one file next to the indexer and
  is meant for local / single-node setups.)
```
