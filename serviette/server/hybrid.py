"""Shared in-process BM25 hybrid retrieval for the vector accessors.

A backend opts in by mixing in :class:`KeywordHybridMixin`, calling
``_init_hybrid(config)`` from its ``__init__``, and implementing the two hooks
``_hybrid_count`` and ``_hybrid_fetch_all``. The mixin then fuses the vector
hits with a BM25 keyword search — built in-process from the backend's stored
chunk texts and rebuilt whenever the row count changes — via reciprocal-rank
fusion (see :func:`serviette.server.ranking.rrf_merge`).

In-process BM25 targets corpora up to a few million chunks; above
``hybrid_max_chunks`` the keyword leg is skipped with a one-time warning and
retrieval degrades to pure vector search. Backends whose engine offers native
server-side keyword scoring should prefer that (planned — see ROADMAP.md);
backends that cannot enumerate their rows at all (Pinecone) cannot use this
mixin and reject ``hybrid: true`` at startup.
